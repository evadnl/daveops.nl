Hi! My name is Dave. I live in the Netherlands and work as a system engineer.

This site will contain my notes, documentation or other interesting content I like to share. You'll mainly find technology topics here.

As my daily job I work as a system engineer, working with Linux, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Windows (Server), Amazon Web Services, Git, Office 365 and Azure Cloud.

In my spare time I like to play games with friends and watch series. I also fiddle around a lot within my homelab, learning new things or just trying out stuff.
